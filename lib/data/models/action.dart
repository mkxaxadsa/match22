    subtitle:
        "In a year where actions of the disgraced former president of the Spanish Royal Football Federation (RFEF), Luis Rubiales, and, more recently, Joey Barton’s sexist rampage have dominated headlines, you could be forgiven for thinking 2023 was a year of setbacks for women’s football and women in football. Yet those incidents, and others, have only looked more ludicrous when contrasted with a Women’s World Cup that captured hearts and generated the second-highest income for any global sporting event – behind the men’s World Cup.\n\nIan Wright said it best before the final of the women’s Euros in 2022, in his characteristically passionate and charming way: \"We don't need to worry about the dinosaurs. I saw someone say something about the dinosaurs screaming at the meteor. I love it – that’s what those negative people are. See how many millions of people have been watching these women play - there's people out there for this game.",

        "This was madness. Six-pointer season, suddenly upon them after Nottingham Forest’s win at Newcastle, had left both teams picking over leftovers. It was Luton who took the spoils from mayhem that was largely Sheffield United’s doing.\n\nWhere Luton’s spirit and determination has been apparent from the opening kicks of the season, it has taken until the second coming of Chris Wilder for the Blades to exhibit similar qualities. In his fifth game since replacing Paul Heckingbottom he ripped up his own gameplan and his team snatched a deserved lead only for composure to desert them. United’s prodigal manager did not conceal his disdain.",

Not only were Chelsea spending \$1bn of transfer money in record-breaking fashion while attempting to rewrite accounting principles, but Citizen Todd was only too happy to tell the world of his exciting plans for the Premier League.\n\nHe hasn’t disappeared completely. Baseball-capped, dressed for the cold, he attended Chelsea’s match with Brighton in early December, but it has been some time since the football public heard from him. Club politics, wider football politics and perhaps most of all, Chelsea’s rather embarrassing slide, have each served to reduce the need for the Marylander to hold forth in the manner that quickly made his name.",
